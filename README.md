### Lesson #2

[Slides](https://goo.gl/4EHTQi)

Useful **git** commands:

- git status
- git log
- git show: Show various types of objects
- git tag: tag specific points in history as being important
  - for example, these commits were tagged with annotation and comment:
      - git tag -a 2 -m "lecture #2"
      - git tag -a 2.1 -m "lecture #2.1"
  - you can now jump between them using:
      - git checkout 2  (..or 2.1)
  - you can see the diff between 2 tags (or between branches) by adding `/compare` to the end of the github workspace URL. 
- git add .
  - adds all un-staged files to your local git index

### Lesson #4

[Slides](https://goo.gl/CXtCcy)

- Make main menu for exercises
  - Refactoring: rename MainActivity and related layout to Lesson2Activity and lesson2_layout
  - Create a new MainActivity to serve as a high level menu for exercises
  - Mark the new activity as MAIN in the manifest

#### Code compare
- [Adding action bar](https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop/compare/4...4.1)
- [Adding settings](https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop/compare/4.1...4.2)
   - Simply create a new "Settings Activity" from the `new > activity` command menu.  
- [Enabling "< Back" from settings](https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop/compare/4.2...4.2.1)
   - By overriding `onOptionsItemSelected()`
- [Showing how to read values from SharedPreferences](https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop/compare/4.2.1...4.2.2)
  - And using AsyncHandler and UiHandler on the way
- [Showing how to write values to SharedPreferences from code](https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop/compare/4.2.2...4.2.3)
- [Added SQL implementation and example](https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop/compare/4.2.3...4.3)


#### print the content of the property file on the emulator
 `adb  -s emulator-5554 shell 'cat /data/data/org.shenkar.auval.codesamples/shared_prefs/org.shenkar.auval.codesamples_preferences.xml'`


#### [Playing with raw SQL](/examples/SQLSample.md)

#### Tips

- clone this workspace to your local pc
  - file -> new -> Project from version control -> GitHub
  - paste https://github.com/auval/AndroidWorkshop.git
  - define local directory for the workspace
  - clone

- creating App Toolbar activity
  - Follow the [tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/appbar/index.html)
    - It's missing some important steps, so read here as well.
  - create an svg resource icon
    - New > “Vector Asset” from the context menu
  - define some menu options
    - New > “Android resource directory” from the context menu
    - Change the “Resource type” drop-down to be “menu”, then click OK to create the directory
    - right-click over your new res/menu/ directory and choose New > “Menu resource file” from the context menu
    - name it "lesson3.xml"
    - add \<item> resources, like the example in the tutorial or your own.
  - Add  `onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {}` to the activity, to inflate menu items

### Lesson 7

     Custom View Animation

[Slides](https://goo.gl/adGjJf)

Lots of examples:

1. Animated view (rotating dot): [MyAnimatedGraphicsView](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/MyAnimatedGraphicsView.java)
    - This view draws directly on the screen buffer, which clears every frame.
    - <img src="/examples/7a_llanim.png" width="144">
2. Animated view (rotating dot on offscreen Bitmap): [MyBitmapAnimatedGraphicsView](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/MyBitmapAnimatedGraphicsView.java)
    - This view draws on an offscreen Bitmap I created, so on each draw I add just one dot, and 
    the bitmaps keeps all the past drawings.
    - It calculates dot position as a function of time, so the movement is independent 
    neither of the speed of the phone nor hiccups of the UI thread. 
    - <img src="/examples/7a_llanim_wbmp.png" width="144">
3. [SpriteAnimationActivity](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/SpriteAnimationActivity.java)
      just puts a custom ViewGroup on the screen.
    - Notice that instead of ConstraintsLayout as root in 
    [the xml](app/src/main/res/layout/activity_sprite_animation.xml) I use SpriteAnimationView.
     custom ViewGroup.
    - The animation happens in [SpriteAnimationView](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/SpriteAnimationView.java)
    - <img src="/examples/7b_llsa.png" width="144">
4. [SvgViewsActivity](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/SvgViewsActivity.java) demonstrates using SVG as a background image, 
and 4 svgs as frames for [animation-list](app/src/main/res/drawable/butterfly.xml) drawable.
    - The drawable is set as src of ImageView, and 
    [started](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/SvgViewsActivity.java#L35) from the Activity.
    - When touching a butterfly, it will fly elsewhere, using 
    [Scene Transition](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/SvgViewsActivity.java#L60).
     This may be a useful reference for building your own game.
    - Notice that this activity has fixed orientation set in 
    [AndroidManifest.xml](app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L45).
    - <img src="/examples/7c_al_svg.png" height="144">
5. [BmpAndSvgActivity](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/BmpAndSvgActivity.java) is not animated. It demonstrates combining 
simple Bitmap as a [background](src/main/res/layout/activity_bmp_and_svg.xml#L8) and an SVG as a 
[srcCompat](src/main/res/layout/activity_bmp_and_svg.xml#L15) drawable of a view.
    - Notice how the svg doesn't lose quality when scaled up or down.
    - On the upper right corner there's a cool (but complex) hack: I took the SVG parsing code 
    from the support library, and [here](app/src/main/java/org/shenkar/auval/codesamples/MyLowLevelSvgView.java#L75) I demonstrate how I turned a raw SVG to a Path object that
     Canvas can draw directly. 
    - <img src="/examples/7d_svg_and_bmp.png" width="144">
     
      
**Note regarding working on the project**: 
You should [learn](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) this method on how to 
collaborate using GitHub. Both students must contribute.
